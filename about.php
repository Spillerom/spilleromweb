		<h1>Hello!</h1>

		<div id="text">
		My name is Pepe and I guess you can call this site my creative playground.<br>
		<br>
		char importantNode[] = "preferably from the 80's";<br>
		<br>
		I basicly love most of the geeky stuff: math&amp;physics, all sorts of programming, sci-fi movies (importantNode), color effects (importantNode), loud chiptune music that makes normal people loose their mind ("Ocean loader 2" FTW) and Japanese.<br>
		<br>
		So, not much more to say I guess. <br>
		<br>
		Oh by the way!
		<br>
		I also do some freelance programming.
